Multi-AI Agent Collaboration System – Hackathon Submission
This project showcases a coordinated system of autonomous AI agents working together to simulate real-world cross-functional collaboration between companies and internal teams. Each agent operates with a clear responsibility—ranging from industry-specific research to innovation planning, market strategy, and executive reporting.

The system demonstrates how distributed intelligence can streamline complex workflows and accelerate decision-making in enterprise environments.

Agent 4:
